# Odin Recipes

This website is an HTML website for showcasing recipies made by me with help from cookbooks, family, and friends.

On top of this it helps me deepen my knowledge with technologies such as git, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Heroku.


## Expected Outcomes

At the end I should be able to, set up GitHub repository, structure websites with Semantic HTML, and view projects on the web with github pages.

## What Did I Learn?

- Hardly comment code 

- Rely on the internet and auto-complete too much when forgetting syntax. 

- Copy and paste old code without understanding it's original purpose.
